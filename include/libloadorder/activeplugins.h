/**
 *  @file activeplugins.h
 *  @brief This file contains the API frontend for active plugin management.
 *
 *  @section valid_apl_sec Valid Active Plugin Lists
 *
 *  Any active plugin list that is set using libloadorder must be valid,
 *  ie. it must meet all the following conditions:
 *  - Contains only installed plugins.
 *  - Contains no duplicate entries.
 *  - Contains no more than 255 plugins.
 *  - If a Skyrim load order, contains `Skyrim.esm`.
 *  - If a Skyrim load order and `Update.esm` is installed, contains
 *    `Update.esm`.
 *
 *  Libloadorder is less strict when loading active plugin lists. If loading
 *  a Skyrim list and Skyrim.esm is missing, it will be inferred to load first.
 *  Similarly, if Update.esm is installed but not in the active list, it will
 *  be inferred to load after all other master files.
